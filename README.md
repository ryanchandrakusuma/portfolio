Adiwarna Antaradar is a volunteer work that I did with my other friends when I was a student on Universitas Kristen Petra to make a website about the event. The event is pretty much an exhibition about the result of the final thesis of Petra's students that majoring in visual communication design. The event also has workshop that taught you how to make an embroidery totebag and using various paper for crafts. My specific role in this work is to make a main page and navbar for the website.

# AI Goal-Oriented Action Planning
AI GOAP is a project that I made for final thesis using Unreal Engine 4. In this thesis, I tried to implement Goal-Oriented Action Planning method to make the AI more adaptive, especially on Turn-based game. The result are, AI GOAP has better result based on how realistic AI's movement are, and level of palyer satisfaction. But in terms of difficulty based on player's opinion, AI with Finite-State Machine is harder than AI GOAP, mostly because the resources that AI FSM has are more than AI GOAP's.<br>

# React Dashboard
React dashboard is a study by myself to make a dashboard using React and NodeJS. For front-end, I used Material UI and Redux Toolkits, while the back-end used Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. My objective is to learn how to make a website using react and fetch the APIs using NodeJS.

# We's MD (On-Progress)
We's MD is an app to read manga with reference from an app named Tachiyomi. I used Flutter and fetch the API straight from the Mangadex itself to make the app. I made this app for personal use, and I'm planning to put it to google play as a free app for everyone to use. My personal objective making this app is to re-learn how to make an app using Flutter and how to use the state management properly.
